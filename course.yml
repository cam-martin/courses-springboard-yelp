description      : Welcome to our tutorial based on the popular <a href="https://www.springboard.com/blog/eat-rate-love-an-exploration-of-r-yelp-and-the-search-for-good-indian-food">Springboard blog post</a> about Yelp Review Modifications. Here you will learn the techniques that the author used to tailor the Yelp star reviews for restaurants. <p>Exercises on importing data, data manipulation and data visualization will teach you how to “cut through the noise” and deliver useful metrics for finding a great place to eat on Friday night! The course is an interesting take on a dilemma that we all face on a regular basis. Is the information that is available to us useful? In many cases, yes, but too often a cloud shrouds the real value that the information has. The best part of this course is getting to explore a real world problem and learning how to remove the haze for yourself!<p/>
